-- Simple RLS Fix for cards table
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor

-- Check current policies

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow anonymous read access" ON cards;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow anonymous insert access" ON cards;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow anonymous update access" ON cards;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow anonymous delete access" ON cards;

-- Create new policies
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous read access" ON cards

CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous insert access" ON cards
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous update access" ON cards

-- Grant permissions (safe)
